# Surreal Scala

Due to some [issues](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb.java/issues/100) with the official SDK that this project relies on, I had to splice the sql myself in order to implement the functionality, and I made a limited effort to secure it (escapes the string input), so I can't ensure that it is secure.
